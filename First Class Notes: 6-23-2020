Notes of what I learned in the first python class 6/23/2020
-Command Prompt to run git commands

cd:change directory
dev:directory
Github-
The information in github saves in the github cloud.
So supposedly if your computer breaks, you can still still use github 
on another computer with all the information, saved. 
Commands to add stuff to the cloud
git add *
git commit -m "new comments added"
git push
Make a code and push it to cloud and you can open it up with another command.
Basic 6 commands
git clone url
git status
git add *
git commit -m "comment here"
git push
gitimage
